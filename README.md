# audio-scene-analysis
In this project, me and my colleague, analyzed databased with audio scene where we had to use machine learning methods for calculating precision and accuracy. For classification methods we used: kNN, SVM and Logistic regression. For reduction of dimensionality we used: PCA and LDA methods.
